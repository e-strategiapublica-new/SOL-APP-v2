# Internationalization

## Translation files

Files are located on branch `feature/add-change-language`, no diretÃ³rio `src/assets/i118n`.

There will be 4 files with different languages:

- `en.json` (English)
- `es.json` (Spanish)
- `fr.json` (French)
- `pt.json` (Portuguese)

> JSON files are used to translate files from the `src/app` directory into their respective languages.

To add a new language, create a file in the same format and in the same directory as the others, copy one of the files, and translate into the language you want.
